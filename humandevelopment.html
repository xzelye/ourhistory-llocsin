      <h2 class="title">The Human Development</h2>
      <img src="brain.jpg" alt="brain" id="image-1" />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;
      <p class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;2.8 million years ago the genus of homo, the humans, emerged. They used tools but did not make a lot of progress for nearly 2 million years.  As our brain evolved we unlocked things that life hasn’t seen before. We expand knowledge quickly, build on past knowledge and have deep insight.</p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;The beginning of human cognition, is the development of a larger brain, which can be represented by artifacts—stone tools, weapons—or productions that signify greater abilities for thinking and innovation. In addition, although the adaptation of a larger brain may separate humans from their primate relatives, it also came at the cost of increased fuel requirements. A human brain uses at least 20 percent of an individual's resting metabolism.&nbsp;</p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;
      <p class="content">&nbsp;Here are the parts of the brain: &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;Frontal Lobe&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;The frontal lobe is the brain's most anterior (front) part. It stretches from the area behind the brow to the precentral gyrus. The frontal lobe is in charge of higher cognitive functions such as memory, emotions, impulse control, problem-solving, social interaction, and motor function as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;Function&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;The frontal lobes are important for voluntary movement, expressive language, and managing higher level executive functions. Executive functions are a set of cognitive abilities that include the ability to plan, organize, initiate, self-monitor, and control one's responses to achieve a goal.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;<b>Temporal lobe&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;The second-largest lobe is the temporal lobe, which is located behind the ears. They are frequently linked to memory encoding and the processing of auditory information. It is also thought that the temporal lobes are crucial for processing affect/emotions, language, and some facets of visual perception.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;Function&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;The temporal lobe is the part of the brain that receives information in the form of sounds from the ears, and gives them meaning. The function of the temporal lobe centers around auditory stimuli, memory, and emotion. This is the first area responsible for interpreting different frequencies, sounds, and pitches.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;<b>Brain Stem&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;Your brainstem is the bottom, stalk like portion of your brain. It connects your brain to your spinal cord. Your brainstem sends messages to the rest of your body to regulate balance, breathing, heart rate and more.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;Function&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;Brain stem is the lowest portion of the brain – or toward the “bottom” of the brain, it is the first part of the brain to process incoming signals, both internal and external. Thus, it influences the type of signal the entire brain receives; for example, fear, joy, or uncertainty.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;Parietal Lobe&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;One of the four major lobes of the cerebral cortex in humans. It sits near the upper back portion of the skull, close to the parietal bone. In the brain, the parietal lobe is located behind the frontal lobe.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;Function&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;The parietal lobe is vital for sensory perception and integration, including the management of taste, hearing, sight, touch, and smell. It is home to the brain's primary somatosensory cortex, a region where the brain interprets input from other areas of the body.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;Occipital Lobe&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;The occipital lobe is the part of the human brain responsible for interpreting information from the eyes and turning it into the world as a person sees it.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;Function&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;The Function of Occipital Lobe is Mapping the visual world, which helps with both spatial reasoning and visual memory. Most vision involves some type of memory, since scanning the visual field requires you to recall that which you saw just a second ago. Determining color properties of the items in the visual field.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;Cerebellum Lobe&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;The region of the brain located behind the brainstem and between it and the cerebrum. For standing and walking, the cerebellum regulates balance in addition to other intricate motor processes.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;Function&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;Researchers believe the cerebellum plays a role in thinking, including processing language and mood, as well as attention, fear response, and pleasure or reward responses.&nbsp;</p>

      <h3 class="title">What part of the brain produces thoughts?</h3>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;The frontal lobe is primarily responsible for thinking, planning, memory, and judgment. The parietal lobe is primarily responsible for bodily sensations and touch.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;But, the cerebrum, the biggest part of the brain is the cerebrum. The cerebrum is the thinking part of the brain and it controls your voluntary muscles — the ones that move when you want them to.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;"I think; therefore, I am." --Rene Descartes, French mathematician and philosopher (1596-1650)&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;How it Works&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;Your brain is key to your intelligence. There are many different ways to define and measure intelligence, though, because it involves many kinds of thinking and uses many parts of the brain. Intelligence includes things like processing speed, memory, empathy, creativity, and connectivity--and the ability to knit these all together. Where does your unique, individual intelligence come from? Some of your abilities are encoded in your DNA. But your brain is also shaped by your individual experiences--the interaction between your genes and your environment.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;Here are some critical functions that your thinking brain oversees:&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;Language&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;The human brain is built for language. But language doesn't just communicate our thoughts. Language also helps make those thoughts possible--by providing the concepts we think with and rules for linking them together.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;Memory&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;Memories are the refiring of the same neurons that fired when you first had a particular thought or experience. You can actually see changes in the neurons when memories form. Synapses can grow stronger as you learn. But memories are often messy and unreliable.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;Reasoning&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;The powers of your brain are astonishing. You can live in the moment, reflect on the past, or imagine the future. You can allow your thoughts to wander in new directions--or train them to shut out the world and focus within.&nbsp;</p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;What is feeling?&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;An emotional encounter gives rise to feelings. This is categorized in the same category as hunger or pain because a person is aware of the sensation. The outcome of an emotion, a feeling can be impacted by memories, beliefs, and other things.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;What is emotion?&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;Emotions are how people react to things or events that have personal significance to them. Emotion is defined as "a complicated reaction pattern, encompassing experiential, behavioral and physiological factors."&nbsp;</p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;What are the difference between feelings and emotions?&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;Feelings are experienced consciously, whereas emotions can appear either consciously or subconsciously. This is a key distinction between the two. Some people may go their entire lives without ever fully comprehending the depths of their feelings.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;What part of the brain is responsible for feeling? And how does it work?&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;Amygdala&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;Amygdala stimulation results in strong emotions like fear or anger. The amygdala is stimulated by irritable lesions of temporal lobe epilepsy. An anxiety attack may occur in the most severe form of irritative lesions of temporal lobe epilepsy. Panic attacks are brief, frequently occurring moments of panic without a clearly defined cause that create a sensation of imminent doom.&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;What is Behavior?&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;Amygdala stimulation results in strong emotions like fear or anger. The amygdala is stimulated by irritable lesions of temporal lobe epilepsy. An anxiety attack may occur in the most severe form of irritative lesions of temporal lobe epilepsy. Panic attacks are brief, frequently occurring moments of panic without a clearly defined cause that create a sensation of imminent doom.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;Behaviour is how someone acts. It is what a person does to make something happen, to make something change or to keep things the same. Behaviour is a response to things that are happening.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;How does Frontal Lobe affects behavior?&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;Focal frontal lobe disorders can cause more readily predictable changes in personality: orbitofrontal cortex lesions usually lead to a disinhibited, acquired sociopathy; dorsolateral cortex lesions disrupt organization, planning, and judgment; and disruption of anterior cingulate gyri results in apathy.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;How does Prefrontal Lobe affect behavior?&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;The prefrontal cortex in primates guides behavior by selecting relevant stimuli for the task at hand, mediated through excitatory bidirectional pathways with structures associated with sensory processing, memory and emotions.&nbsp;</p>
