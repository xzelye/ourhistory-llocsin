      <p class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;In its 4.54 billion years, Earth's history predates way before we, humans, set foot on its soil. Time marched forward, giving way to evolutionary change which brought us to the world we have today. With that said, It is believed that it is a necessity that we acknowledge the geological periods of this world's ancestry and ours. </p>

      <p class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;The geological time scale dates back from the <b>Precambrian Era</b> - the earliest part of Earth history. Also known as the <b>"Age of Early Life"</b>, this particular time period was when the continents were formed and our modern atmosphere developed, alongside the flourishing of early life. Soft-bodied creatures like worms and jellyfish lived in the world's oceans, but the land remained barren. Common Precambrian fossils include stromatolites and similar structures, which are traces of mats of algae-like microorganisms, and microfossils of other microorganisms. With its time span, the Precambrian was divided into 3 eons: <b>Hadean, Archean, and Proterozoic</b>.</p>

      <p class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;After the mass extinction that ended the Precambrian, we come down to the <b>Paleozoic Era</b>. A major interval of geologic time that began 541 million years ago with the Cambrian explosion, an extraordinary diversification of marine animals, and ended about 252 million years ago with the end-Permian extinction, the greatest extinction event in Earth history. Much like Precambrian, its time span can be divided into 6 main parts: <b>Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian</b>. </p>

      <p class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;The exact reason as to why this era ended is unconfirmed but it paved the way for the <b>Mesozoic Era</b>. 3rd of Earth’s 4 major geologic eras of Phanerozoic time. Its name is derived from the Greek term for <b>“Middle Life.”</b> The Mesozoic Era began 252.2 million years ago, following the conclusion of the Paleozoic Era, and ended 66 million years ago, at the dawn of the Cenozoic Era. The major divisions of the Mesozoic Era are, from oldest to youngest, the <b>Triassic Period, the Jurassic Period, and the Cretaceous Period</b>. </p>

      <p class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mesozoic Era ended with the dinosaurs' extinction, caused by a massive meteorite impact. What came next was the <b>Cenozoic Era</b>, the most recent of the three major subdivisions of animal history. The Cenozoic spans only about 65 million years, from the end of the Cretaceous Period and the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs to the present. The Cenozoic is sometimes called the <b>Age of Mammals</b>, because the largest land animals have been mammals during that time. Likewise, due to time span, the Cenozoic was divided into two periods: <b>Tertiary and Quaternary</b>. </p>
