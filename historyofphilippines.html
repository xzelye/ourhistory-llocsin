      <h3 class="title">Batalla de Mactan</h1>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;The battle narratives of Lapu-Lapu and Magellan were among the oldest and most well-known in the Philippines. They claimed that one of Lapu-warriors Lapu's shot Magellan once with a poisoned arrow, killing him instantly. But what actually transpired during the fight? And how did the conflict take place?&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;It all began when Ferdinand Magellan's proposal was turned down in his native Portugal. He then traveled to Spain to ask the same question of their ruler. Magellan's suggestion that he would want to lead an expedition to discover the Spice Islands, or Moluccas, was accepted by Spain's Holy Emperor Charles V. Even though Portugal and Spain were rivals at the time, they nonetheless backed Magellan's strategy. Antonio Pigafetti and Magellan embarked on their mission on September 20th, 1521.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;On March 17, 1521, they sailed the Pacific Ocean and found Humuno Island, also known as Homonhon, in Samar. The sailors bartered their tools and clothing for food with the locals. Magellan had made friends with the island's rulers. Enrique de Malacca, his Malay prisoner, assisted Magellan in communicating with the inhabitants by translating. He recognized the chance to bring Christianity to the island. On Mazana, now referred to as Limasawa, Magellan's crew organized the first church service ever held in the Philippines.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;After a week, Magellan departed Limasawa due to a lack of supplies. They continued their journey and eventually arrived at Cebu, a larger island. With the aid of a Muslim visitor from Siam who had forewarned them about the Spaniard's fury, the chiefs of Cebu have agreed to accept Magellan. The leaders of the Cebuano people have embraced Christ and consented to baptism. They have adopted the names that Magellan gave them, which were drawn from the names of the Spanish monarchs.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;The Spanish sailors reached Mactan on April 26, 1521. They insisted that the natives convert to Christianity and pay homage. However, Cilapulapu or Lapu-Lapu refused, which emboldened the Spanish. The Spanish were proud because they had far more advanced technology than the natives, yet the locals still fought with what they had because Mactan refused to serve the King of Spain.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;The Spaniards killed numerous warriors and civilians while burning and destroying the homes of Mactan, which infuriated the inhabitants. The Spanish were gradually losing the conflict on day two. Even before Magellan ordered his people to submit, the majority of his men had already left. Magellan had no men nearby when he sustained serious injuries. He was killed by the villagers after they attacked him.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;The conflict at Mactan is regarded as the first conflict in Philippine history. This demonstrated the courage and cohesion of the Filipino people. How fiercely they guard their culture and land. However, the Spanish have such a significant advantage that, with determination and zeal, they can overcome the conquerors.&nbsp;</p>

      <h3 class="title">Ang Katipunan at Phillipine-American War</h1>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;Taong 1521 nang sinakop ng mga kastila ang bansang Pilipinas. Kung saan maraming pilipino ang naghirap, nagdusa at marami ring namatay. Makamtan lang ang inaasam na kalayaan mula sa kamay ng mga kastila, maraming pilipino ang nagbuwis ng kani-kanilang buhay, isa na rito si Andres Bonifacio.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;Ika-7 ng Hulyo taong 1892, sa pamumuno ni Bonifacio kasama sina Valentin, Jacinto at iba pa, itinatag ang samahang KKK. Naglalayon itong labanan ang mga mananakop nang sa gayo'y mabawi ang lugar na inangkin ng bansang Espanya. Agosto 26, 1896 sa Balintawak naganap ang pagpunit ng kanilang mga sedula na naglalaman ng buwis na ipinataw sa kanila ng mga espanyol kung saan naging simbolo ito ng kanilang pagprotesta, nagsimula na ang kanilang paghahanda sa nasabing pagsugod. Sa kasamaang palad, hindi nagwagi ang KKK laban sa mga kastila dahil sa kakulangan ng armas at tao. Natapos ang samahan taong 1897, ika-22 ng Mayo.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;Nobyembre 2, 1897 nang maging pangulo si Emilio Aguinaldo. Sa kanyang pangunguna, nagsimula ang usapan tungkol sa pagiging kalaban o kakampi ng Amerika. Sa gitna ng kanilang diskusyon ay nagkaroon ng iba't-ibang opinyon. Ayon kay Heneral Luna, sa halip na sila'y nag-uusap, mas mabuting lumusob na sa mga Amerikano na nasa Intramuros habang sila'y mas kaunti pa kaysa sa mga pilipinong sundalo. Sa kabilang banda, payapang-usapan ang gusto ng pangulo. Nahati ang pagpupulong kung saan ang iba'y sang-ayon sa sinabi ni Heneral Luna, at may mga sumang-ayon din sa sinabi ni pangulong Emilio Aguinaldo." &nbsp;</p>

      <p class="content">&nbsp;The film was about the late Filipino social organization called KKK (kagalang galangang, kataas taasang katipunan) and their revolution that started on July 7, 1892. Which is the continues war between the Spanish and Filipinos.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;Did you catch it? This film features functions! In the scene where Bonifacio and Jacinto were preparing for the war, they secretly gathered weapons that they will use for the fight against the Spaniards. They need to buy weapons for their soldiers that costs 200 silvers each. So how did they know how much silver would it cover for all of their soldiers?&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content"><b>&nbsp;Problem:&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;Give a function <i>f</i> that can represent the cost of buying <i>x</i> amount of weapons if one gun costs 200 silvers each?&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;Let’s assume that they have to buy weapons for 20, 40, 60, and 100 soldiers:&nbsp;</p>
      <img src="mathtable.png" alt="math" id="image-3" />
      <p class="content">&nbsp;Therefore, the function of this problem is <b>f(x)=200x.&nbsp;</b></p>
